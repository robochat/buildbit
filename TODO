    
add checks to PatternRule - PatternRules should have no entries in their self.explicit_rules attribute
write unittests
general testing of system and all of its features - currently only have example.py
unit test for build orders that use the _seen() functionality
unit test that individuated MetaRules don't add themselves to the ExplicitRule registry.
improve commandline interface - buildseq could be prettified. 
could also turn buildseq into a graphviz? but would want to show untouched vertices too... override get_mtime?
Add a shared patternrule class
write README.md and setup.py
    Emphasize where buildbit is different from make - 
        shared rules, 
        pattern rules are not currently shared,
        req wildcards also search explicitrule registry.
    build should not be calculation order dependent i.e. dependent upon order of rule analysis.
        it shouldn't depend on prerequisite order etc.
Add unit tests for prerequisite order and individuation of MetaRules...
