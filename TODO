    
add checks to PatternRule - PatternRules should have no entries in their self.explicit_rules attribute
write unittests
general testing of system and all of its features - currently only have example.py
unit test for build orders that use the _seen() functionality
unit test that individuated MetaRules don't add themselves to the ExplicitRule registry.
improve commandline interface - buildseq could be prettified. 
could also turn buildseq into a graphviz? but would want to show untouched vertices too... override get_mtime?
