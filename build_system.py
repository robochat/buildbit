Design Questions

Each feature seems to raise a question.

multiple targets: Does this mean that one run of the recipe makes all of the targets? Or
    does it mean that the recipe varies depending upon the target requested. Make choses
    the second option since we can use $@ to get the requested target name and hence make
    the recipe dependent upon the name. However, the second option could lead to the same
    recipe being unnecessarily run multiple times. Currently this system uses the first
    option.
    
wildcard targets: Basically has the same problem as the multiple targets case.

wildcard prerequisites: When do we look for files that match the rules? Before the build has
    started. After any order_only rules have run? Just before the rule is due to run - except
    how can we sort out the build order in this case?
